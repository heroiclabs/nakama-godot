- The client now supports auto-retrying failed request due to network error. This is enabled by defulut.

### Backwards incompatible changes

- The "received_error" signal on "NakamaSocket" is now emited with an "NakamaRTAPI.Error" object received from the server.
  Previously, it was emitted with an integer error code when the socket failed to connect.
  If you have old code using the "received_error" signal, you can switch to the new "connection_error" signal, which was added to replace it.
